# Vuma Web Studio

Project starter for CS 1XD3 Lab 2.2. This static website includes four core pages, shared styling, and a placeholder client landing page.

## Pages
- `index.html` — Home
- `about.html` — Team
- `project.html` — Project summary + client report download
- `showcase.html` — Lab showcase

## Client landing page
See `client/index.html` for the basic client hero and section placeholders.

## Assets
Placeholder images live in `assets/img` and can be replaced with real team photos later.

## Dependencies
This site is plain HTML/CSS only. There are no external libraries or build steps.

## Deployment (GitHub Pages)
1) Push the `vuma-web-studio` folder to a GitHub repo.
2) In GitHub: Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → select `main` and `/ (root)` or `/vuma-web-studio` if the repo contains other folders.
3) Ensure all links remain relative (they already are).

## Asset checklist
- `css/style.css` (shared across all pages)
- `assets/img/logo.png`
- `assets/img/hero.png`
- `assets/img/feature-bg.jpg` (optional; gradient fallback used if missing)
- `assets/img/team/member1.jpg` ... `member4.jpg` (optional)
- `assets/img/icons/design.png`, `development.png`, `collaboration.png`
